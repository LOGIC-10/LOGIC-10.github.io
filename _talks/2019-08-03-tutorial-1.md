### Sharing Session for Frye Aviation Artificial Intelligence Competition

I gave a lecture on this sharing session, mainly teaching DJI users and children the basic principles, common applications and domain migration capabilities of convolutional neural networks. During this presentation, I also demonstrated the application of neural networks in computer vision by programming robots on the spot to implement the function of object tracking.
