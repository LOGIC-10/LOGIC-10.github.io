### Technical Interpretation and Application Thinking of ChatGPT

In this seminar, I described the principle of the technical route from GPT1 to GPT3 and the comparison between the GPT and BERT model. What's more, I shared some tuning method based on several LLMs. Combining the research and knowledge accumulation in reinforcement learning, I shared the research results with my colleagues and superiors through a 35-page PPT, and discussed the application route of LLMs in the future direction of the company's business.
