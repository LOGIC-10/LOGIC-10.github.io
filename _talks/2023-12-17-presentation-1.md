### Discussion about llm-based Agents and an Introduction to RepoAgent and XAgent

In this talk, I explored the real-world capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the practical applications of AI agents. I introduced RepoAgent, which is a llm-based tool created by my team to automatically generate and maintain code documents.Futhermore, I talked about our previous work -- XAgent, which is designed to solve a wide range of tasks autonomously by leveraging a multi-agent architecture that incorporates components for task dispatching, planning, and action execution. 

In the end, I combined my previous research experience at Car lab to introduce a thought: What impacts will LLM-based agents have on our real life?
