Hi~ I am **Qinyu Luo**, Welcome to my Github HomePage.

I was born in 2001 and I am currently on the verge of graduating with a bachelor's degree from Hohai University. Soon, I will be pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science track at Johns Hopkins University. In the future, I will focus my research interest on the combination of Healthcare, Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning. To get a comprehensive overview of my research experience and project history, please refer to the **[resume]()** section.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I possess a deep passion for sharing my practical experience and perspectives. I have had several opportunities to deliver lectures and speeches in public settings. Moving forward, I am eager to expand my reach and plan to create tutorials on open-source platforms. I sincerely invite you to keep up with my updates and discuss with me in detail.

Currently, I am actively seeking researchers who share an interest in Intelligent Healthcare. I am enthusiastic about collaborating on meaningful projects that have the potential to bring about real change in this field. If you possess a similar passion and have research experience in Large Language Models or Reinforcement Learning, or if you are knowledgeable in web development and system administration, please please do not hesitate to contact me through **qinyu_luo@163.com**.
