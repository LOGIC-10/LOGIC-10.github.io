# Intelligent Stethoscope

My career goal is to use technology to help people in remote areas and improve their lives. When the COVID-19 epidemic broke out in 2020, I saw an opportunity to apply my coding skills. While my father was fighting the pandemic as a doctor and professor of medicine, I noticed that doctors couldn't use traditional stethoscopes while wearing protective suits. I ask myself -- why not invent a wireless stethoscope and equip it with AI algorithms for telemedicine usage?

So I invented this intelligent Stethoscope:

This minimum viable product has ability to daignose and record patient's information in a save way with our model and APPs. As you can see, the waveform shows every detail of the heart sound, which assists doctors to better understand the situation and give precise judgement.

*The waveform demonstrate many details, including S1 and S2, as well as many that human cannot hear.*

Also, there are many amazing functions I will develop in the future, like auto heart rate detection.

What's more, I plan to combine LLM techs with multimodality to establish a complete intelligent mechanism to assist doctors.*** Currently, I am looking for a team consists of self-motivative members. If you're experienced or interested in this field, I would be very glad to discuss its future and cooperate with you.***
