# Intelligent Stethoscope

My career goal is to use technology to help people in remote areas and improve their lives. When the COVID-19 epidemic broke out in 2020, I saw an opportunity to apply my coding skills. While my father was fighting the pandemic as a doctor and professor of medicine, I noticed that doctors couldn't use traditional stethoscopes while wearing protective suits. I ask myself -- why not invent a wireless stethoscope and equip it with AI algorithms for telemedicine usage?

So I invented this intelligent Stethoscope
